![Bollinger Bands Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/eckldDh.png)

The Bollinger Bands chart is an advanced tool for market analysis that shows the stock's adjusted close price along with its volatility. Bollinger Bands consist of:

- **Adjusted Close (Orange Line)**: This line represents the stock's adjusted closing prices over time, reflecting the final price after accounting for any corporate actions.

- **Bollinger High (Red Dashed Line)**: The upper Bollinger Band is plotted two standard deviations above a simple moving average and represents a higher level of volatility or resistance.

- **Bollinger Low (Green Dashed Line)**: The lower Bollinger Band is plotted two standard deviations below the same simple moving average, indicating a lower level of volatility or support.

Together, these bands encapsulate the price movement of a stock, providing a visual representation of its volatility. When the bands are closer together, it indicates a period of lower volatility, and when they are further apart, it suggests higher volatility. Traders often use these bands to predict short-term price movements and to identify overbought or oversold conditions.

### Volatility Analysis, MACD Indicator, Interactive Indicator Selection & Stochastic Oscillator
![Volatility Analysis and MACD Indicator Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/sERcVcO.png)

This section of the interface provides two critical analytical tools to assess stock behavior:

#### Date Range Selection (Important for Machine Learning)
- **Start Date**: Users can specify the starting point of their analysis, allowing them to focus on a particular period of interest.
- **End Date**: Similarly, the end date can be selected to narrow down the analysis timeframe, providing control over the data being analyzed.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note**: When selecting the date range, ensure that the period is long enough to provide sufficient data for the ARIMA and LSTM forecasting models. These models require a robust dataset to generate accurate predictions and avoid potential errors. Refer to the source code for specific data requirements related to these models.

#### Volatility Analysis
- **Historical Volatility**: This metric, shown as a percentage, indicates the degree of variation or fluctuation in the stock's trading price over the historical period selected. A higher percentage represents higher volatility, which can imply greater risk or potential for a higher return.

### MACD Indicator Detailed View
![MACD Indicator Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/afkX0Hf.png)

The MACD Indicator chart is a focused view that traders use for identifying changes in the momentum of a stock's price, which can signal potential buy or sell opportunities.

- **MACD Line (Green)**: This is the main line that indicates the momentum of the stock. It's calculated by subtracting the 26-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. Rapid movements in the MACD line can suggest trend changes and potential price reversals.

- **Signal Line (Red)**: The signal line is an EMA of the MACD line, typically over 9 periods. Crossovers between the MACD line and the signal line can indicate bullish or bearish entry and exit points. For example, when the MACD line crosses above the signal line, it may be considered a bullish signal, while a cross below could suggest a bearish market sentiment.

The interaction between these two lines is crucial for technical analysts and traders. The MACD line's crossing above the signal line can indicate a time to buy, and crossing below can be a signal to sell. The distance between the MACD and the signal line also reflects the strength of the momentum. A wider gap can suggest stronger momentum and a more robust trend.

### Stochastic Oscillator
![Stochastic Oscillator Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/OTvaiuw.png)

The Stochastic Oscillator is a momentum indicator comparing a particular closing price of a security to a range of its prices over a certain period of time. The sensitivity of the oscillator to market movements is reducible by adjusting that time period or by taking a moving average of the result.

- **%K line (Blue)**: This line represents the actual value of the stochastic oscillator for each session. It's a measure of the current price relative to the high-low range over a set number of periods. Traditionally, the %K line is drawn as a solid line.

- **%D line (Orange)**: This is a simple moving average of the %K line, which is usually set at three periods. It's drawn as a dashed line and acts as a signal line to the %K line. The %D line helps to identify potential reversals or trend strength.

- **Overbought and Oversold Indicators (Red and Green Horizontal Lines)**: The oscillator ranges from 0 to 100. Typically, readings above 80 are considered overbought, and readings below 20 are considered oversold. These levels can be adjusted based on the security's historical performance.

- **Highlighted Regions**: The chart often highlights the areas where the oscillator indicates overbought or oversold conditions. Overbought conditions can suggest a potential sell opportunity, and oversold conditions can indicate a potential buy opportunity.

Traders use the stochastic oscillator to generate buy and sell signals. A buy signal is suggested when the %K line crosses up through the %D line, especially if the security is in an oversold state. Conversely, a sell signal is suggested when the %K line crosses down through the %D line and the security is in an overbought state.

### Interactive Indicator Selection
![Interactive Indicator Selection Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/fqen78m.png)

The Interactive Indicator Selection chart offers a dynamic way to visualize multiple technical indicators simultaneously for comprehensive stock analysis.

- **Adjusted Close (Solid Blue Line)**: This line represents the adjusted closing price of the stock, accounting for dividends, splits, and other corporate actions, providing a clear picture of the stock's valuation over time.

- **SMA (Dashed Orange Line)**: The Simple Moving Average (SMA) is plotted to smooth out price data by creating a constantly updated average price over a specific time period, helping to identify trends.

- **Bollinger Bands**:
  - **Upper Band (Dotted Green Line)**: Set two standard deviations above the SMA, this line helps identify potential overbought conditions.
  - **Lower Band (Dotted Red Line)**: Set two standard deviations below the SMA, this line helps identify potential oversold conditions.

- **Indicator Checkboxes**: Users can interactively select or deselect specific indicators like SMA, EMA, Bollinger Bands, and RSI to customize the chart view. This interactivity allows for a tailored analysis experience, focusing on the indicators that are most relevant to the user's strategy.

By using the interactive checkboxes, users can ensure they are selecting the right combination of indicators for their analysis. It's important to note that when choosing the date range for this analysis, it must be sufficient for the ARIMA and LSTM models to function correctly, as insufficient data can lead to errors. Users should reference the code to understand the required data range for these models to ensure a smooth analysis experience.
